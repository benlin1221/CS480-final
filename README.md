# CS480-final
Final Project for my machine learning class at the University of Waterloo, Winter 2023

For this project, the class entered a kaggle competition to categorize products into different categories using noisy data including images and descriptions. You can find my model in the .ipynb file and a report detailing how the project worked in the pdf file.
